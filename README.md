### Hi there! 😁

My name is Bruno Assis from Brazil (🇧🇷). I'm an undergraduate student on Automotive Engineering. I'm passionate about programming and currently I'm studying and developing React projects in order to work in the web/mobile development area (🔭).

In my free time I like to hang out with friends and have a beer (🍺), play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), listen to music (🎵) and play guitar (🎸).

Check out my LinkedIn and contact me (📫)!
